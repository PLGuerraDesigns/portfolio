The LED wall decor was made as an art piece for a friend. The signs' colors and patterns are controllable using the Blynk app.

It features an Arduino MKR1000 controlling eight RGB LEDs and connects to the internet using its onboard WiFi module. The LED cover plate is interchangeable using magnets. A USB micro cable is used for continuous power, but the device can also be powered using a 3.7V LiPo battery and charged with the MKR's onboard charging circuit. One of the LEDs was not working at the time the photos were taken.
