The goal of the Xbox Head Tracking project was to design an Xbox compatible head tracking device to track the user's head movements and move the in-game camera.

The circuit comprises an Arduino microcontroller that reads incoming data from an MPU-6050 (three-axis accelerometer) to track the user's head movements and then controls a digital potentiometer. The output of the digital potentiometer connects to wires added on a modified after-market Xbox controller. The added wires lead directly to the game controller's internal circuit board input for the analog thumbsticks.
