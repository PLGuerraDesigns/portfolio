The goal of the AMG GT3 Wheel project was to design and build a functional, 3D-printed replica of the Mercedes Benz AMG GT3 steering wheel for use in Sim Racing.

An Arduino Nano powers the wheel and features a thumb-slide joystick, eight pushbuttons, and a pair of paddle shifters. The wheel is directly compatible with the Thrustmaster ecosystem.

You can find the 3D-printable files on Thingiverse along with an assembly manual, circuit files, and Arduino code.
