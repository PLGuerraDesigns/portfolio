The goal of Project LeMans was to build a relatively low-budget sim racing rig out of easy-to-access parts and materials. It needed to have the basic functionality of a sim racing wheel and pedal set.

It features a Teensy for the brains, emulating a gaming controller and supporting input from the steering wheel's rotation, its two buttons, pair of paddle shifters, as well as the throttle, brakes, and clutch located on the pedal base.
