As a Graduate Research Assistant at the AM³ Lab, University of Arkansas, I played a pivotal role in advancing the cutting-edge field of 3D printing technology. The AM³ Lab is dedicated to developing next generation 3D printing technologies and promoting the use of 3D printing technology to better our lives through excellent research, education, and service to the global 3D printing community.

Initially on-boarded as a volunteer, I assisted in troubleshooting and enhancing the 5th-Generation 3D printers. My dedication and problem-solving skills quickly earned me the position of Graduate Research Assistant, where I continued my contributions to the field.

My primary focus during my time with the lab was developing a groundbreaking swarm 3D printing process designed to enable the production of large-scale structures using a fleet of mobile robots. This innovative approach involved a combination of hardware and software components, including custom-built transporter robots, SCARA 3D printers, and a modular print & power-delivery floor.

Most notably, I was instrumental in transitioning from the 5th-Generation platform to the 6th and 7th-Generations. This transition involved separating the SCARA arm from the mobile base, and optimizing the hardware for improved robustness, efficiency, and quality. I assumed a significant role in these evolutions, taking charge of software development and contributing to hardware enhancements.

One of my key contributions was the implementation of Computer Vision for localization and navigation within the transporter's control system, enabling semi-autonomous operation - a significant advancement in the field.

Not only was my work at the AM³ Lab a valuable learning experience, but also a contribution to the lab's mission of pushing the boundaries of 3D printing technology. I am proud to have been part of a team dedicated to revolutionizing manufacturing and enabling mass customization through next-generation 3D printing innovations.
