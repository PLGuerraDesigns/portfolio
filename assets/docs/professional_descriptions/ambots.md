As the Lead Robotics Engineer at AMBOTS Inc., I had the privilege of spearheading the transformation of groundbreaking research from the AMÂ³ Lab at the University of Arkansas into a game-changing commercial product. AMBOTS Inc. is dedicated to revolutionizing the future of manufacturing through its patent-pending swarm 3D printing and assembly technologies, which were originally conceived by Dr. Wenchao Zhou in 2015.

Our vision at AMBOTS was nothing short of a manufacturing revolution - a world where production is fully digitized and automated, allowing for the creation of customized products on demand, all at a remarkably low cost. Similar to how a swarm of bees collaborates to build its nest, our smart and autonomous mobile robots were engineered to work seamlessly together, translating digital designs into tangible products.

The team and I achieved some remarkable milestones some of which include:

- Our groundbreaking work earned us recognition within the industry, including winning the prestigious "3D Startup of the Year" by 3D Natives. We were also featured on GE Reports as one of "The 5 Coolest Things On Earth This Week" and received coverage on CBS, including an appearance on "The Henry Ford's Innovation Nation."

- We filed patent applications to protect our swarm 3D printing and assembly technology, solidifying our position as pioneers in the field.

- Our dedication and innovation secured Phase I and Phase II of the SBIR grant, totaling $1,225,000 in funding, which fueled our continued growth and development.

- We landed our company's first customer, validating the real-world applicability of our technology.

My time as the Lead Robotics Engineer at AMBOTS Inc. was marked by a relentless dedication to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in advanced manufacturing. I am proud to have played a pivotal role in bringing the vision of fully automated, on-demand, and cost-effective digital manufacturing closer to reality. Our journey continues, and I look forward to witnessing where the future of this transformative technology takes us.
