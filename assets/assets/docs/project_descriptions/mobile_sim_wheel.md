The Mobile Sim Wheel Kit is a fully 3D-printable steering wheel designed for mobile sim racing. This project is based on one of my earlier and very successful projects, the [AMG GT3 Wheel Kit for the Thrustmaster ecosystem](http://localhost:57724/#/home/personal-projects/details/amg-gt3-wheel). The wheel's compact dimensions (230mm x 130mm) and integrated clamp make it ideal for mobile use, offering a satisfying racing experience with games that support tilt-to-steer.

## Materials and Methods

The previously created SVG file for the AMG GT3 wheel was modified in Adobe Illustrator to remove unnecessary details and make the design more mobile-friendly. The altered SVG file was loaded into Fusion 360 and scaled to the desirable dimensions (230 x 130 mm). The wheel was then enhanced, integrating grip handles and slots for attaching a mobile phone mount. The phone mount was adapted from a [Thingiverse design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2194278) and tailored to the wheel's dimensions.

The final model was exported as STL files and then sliced with Cura. The wheel was printed with PLA filament in less than 15 hours on an Ender 3.

The components were assembled in under 30 minutes using glue and snap-fit connections.

The wheel's design was iterated following testing. The final version includes 'fidget' buttons with a TPU-based spring mechanism, a reworked handle design that closely resembles the actual AMG GT3 wheel, thumb cutouts on the phone mount for easier access to the screen's edges, and improved tolerances for the snap-fit connections.

## Results

The final Mobile Sim Wheel kit achieved its design objectives. The reduced dimensions made it easier to utilize mobile devices, while the built-in handles and improved phone mount ensured secure and comfortable use during gameplay. The inclusion of 'fidget' buttons and a modified grip design added to a more realistic appearance.

## Discussion

The Mobile Sim Wheel kit's design process demonstrated the value of testing and iteration in creating a functional and user-friendly product. The use of 3D-printable spring mechanisms for the 'fidget' buttons removed the need for extra hardware. However, even after evaluating several designs and materials, it was difficult to provide the desired tactile feedback and durability. This problem would be best solved with off-the-shelf springs for improved feedback and longevity. The phone mount's cutouts improved the overall user experience on iOS devices allowing interaction with the home bar in landscape mode.

## Conclusion

The Mobile Sim Wheel kit provides a simple and practical solution for mobile sim racing enthusiasts. The kit uses 3D printing technology to provide a cost-effective and customized solution that is quick and easy to assemble. The project showcases 3D printing's ability to create useful, high-quality goods adapted to unique objectives. The design and testing phases revealed areas for improvement, such as the use of genuine springs for the 'fidget' buttons. Overall, the Mobile Sim Wheel kit offers an immersive and enjoyable racing experience on mobile devices, which enhances gameplay for sim racers.
