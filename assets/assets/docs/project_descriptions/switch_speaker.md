The goal of the Nintendo Switch speaker project was to design and build a speaker attachment that would be louder than the Switch's built-in speakers.

The attachment features a 3.5mm audio plug, dual mini oval speakers, a rechargeable LiPo battery, a micro USB charging port, sliding power switch, power LED, and charging status LED.
