The Apple Charging Station, initially sketched in 2016, was later revived and given as a gift to a friend.

Redesigned in Autodesk Fusion 360, printed using wood-infused PLA, and finished with a wood stain. Supports charging of an iPhone, Apple Watch, and the original AirPods. The charging modules are interchangeable to support different product dimensions.
