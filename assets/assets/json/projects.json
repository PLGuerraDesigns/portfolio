    "description": "Designed for mobile sim racing, the AMG GT3/GT4 Mobile Sim Wheel kit is a completely 3D-printable steering wheel. It is a remix of one of my earlier and highly popular projects, the AMG GT3 Wheel Kit for Thrustmaster, now optimized for mobile use. The AMG inspired wheel has been shrunk down to 230mm x 130mm, with built in grip handles and slots for attaching a phone mount. The wheel supports mobile games using tilt to steer and tap to accelerate or break.\n\nThe kit itself contains all STL files for the wheel, phone mount, and an assembly manual. Total print time can be completed in under 15 hours (varies based on print settings and materials), while assembly time takes approximately 30 minutes.\n\nVersion 2 of the wheel was designed to more closely resemble the AMG GT3 wheel. The handles were updated to match the actual style and 'fidget' buttons were added for a more realistic look and feel. Several spring mechanisms were tested with different materials to allow for fully 3D-printable parts that can be assembled without the need for additional hardware. The phone clamp was also updated to included thumb cutouts for easier access to the screen during gameplay.",

    "description": "The goal of the Xbox Head Tracking project was to design an Xbox compatible head tracking device to track the user's head movements and move the in-game camera.\n\nThe circuit comprises an Arduino microcontroller that reads incoming data from an MPU-6050 (three-axis accelerometer) to track the user's head movements and then controls a digital potentiometer. The output of the digital potentiometer connects to wires added on a modified after-market Xbox controller. The added wires lead directly to the game controller's internal circuit board input for the analog thumbsticks.\n\nYou can find the build guide on Instructables.com.",

    "description": "The Handroid project was a science fair submission for my junior year of high school. The idea was inspired by arms developed in medical fields, where mechanical arms can mimic finger movements.\n\nThe shape of the arm was made using foam, cardboard, pieces of wood, and fiberglass. Rubber tubes are used for the fingers with incisions made at the bending points. The fingertips are each connected to a fishing line, which routes internally through the finger and arm, then attaches to the horn of a servo motor. An Arduino microcontroller controls the servo motors and receives input from a modified glove with flex sensors attached to each finger. When the input glove is worn, the flex sensors record the amount of bending of each finger which the Arduino uses to determine the degree of rotation for each servo motor to replicate the users' finger movements.",
