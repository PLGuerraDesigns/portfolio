The process was developed to enable the manufacturing of large-scale structures by a swarm of mobile robots. The process was developed using a combination of hardware and software. The hardware consisted of a custom-built mobile robot, a custom-built 3D printer, and a custom-built robotic arm. The software consisted of a custom-built path planning algorithm and a custom-built control system.",
