    "description": "The goal of the Xbox Head Tracking project was to design an Xbox compatible head tracking device to track the user's head movements and move the in-game camera.\n\nThe circuit comprises an Arduino microcontroller that reads incoming data from an MPU-6050 (three-axis accelerometer) to track the user's head movements and then controls a digital potentiometer. The output of the digital potentiometer connects to wires added on a modified after-market Xbox controller. The added wires lead directly to the game controller's internal circuit board input for the analog thumbsticks.\n\nYou can find the build guide on Instructables.com.",

    "description": "The Handroid project was a science fair submission for my junior year of high school. The idea was inspired by arms developed in medical fields, where mechanical arms can mimic finger movements.\n\nThe shape of the arm was made using foam, cardboard, pieces of wood, and fiberglass. Rubber tubes are used for the fingers with incisions made at the bending points. The fingertips are each connected to a fishing line, which routes internally through the finger and arm, then attaches to the horn of a servo motor. An Arduino microcontroller controls the servo motors and receives input from a modified glove with flex sensors attached to each finger. When the input glove is worn, the flex sensors record the amount of bending of each finger which the Arduino uses to determine the degree of rotation for each servo motor to replicate the users' finger movements.",
