The idea was inspired by arms developed in medical fields, where mechanical arms can mimic finger movements.\n\nThe shape of the arm was made using foam, cardboard, pieces of wood, and fiberglass. Rubber tubes are used for the fingers with incisions made at the bending points. The fingertips are each connected to a fishing line, which routes internally through the finger and arm, then attaches to the horn of a servo motor. An Arduino microcontroller controls the servo motors and receives input from a modified glove with flex sensors attached to each finger. When the input glove is worn, the flex sensors record the amount of bending of each finger which the Arduino uses to determine the degree of rotation for each servo motor to replicate the users' finger movements.",
